June and December, two amazing months with drastically different weather(s).  While viewing temperature statistics for June and December to gauage success of beginning a surf shop, we found the following:


# Results

 -- Standard deviation is 3.25 in June and 3.75 -- making a .5 difference in the two different seasons

# Summary 

Taking a look at our data we see attributes such as precipitation and temperature. Utilizing this data we can determine viability of an ice cream surf shop. AS you can seein both June and December you still have 1500+ people, slightly less than the 1700 people in June. This shows us although there is a slight difference it would still be sustainable to operate a business.
